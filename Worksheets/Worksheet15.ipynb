    "Plinko is a game from the game show The Price is Right where a puck is placed into the top of a board with pegs in it. As the puck falls down the board, it hits the pegs and shifts to the right or the left with equal probability. Traditionally, If the puck hits the edge of the board, a bumper pushes it back to the last spot again. There are buckets at the bottom of the board for the puck to fall into with various prizes. But you can also play Plinko with a triangular board so the puck can never fall out "
