# PHYS 210 - INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS (FALL 2025) 

## PREPARING FOR PHYS 210

**Bring your own computer.** You'll need your own computer for this course, but don't worry—any device with a web browser will do! We'll be using the web-based Jupyter Open platform (https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca/), so your computer's power-level isn't important.

**Get a head start with Python!** If you’re new to Python or haven’t used it in a while, we recommend brushing up before the start of the term. The early weeks move quickly through Python basics like variables, lists, conditionals, functions, and loops—many of which aren't fully covered in Physics 119. To prepare, check out the free [*Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)*](https://www.py4e.com/) course (Google account required). It’s also available on Coursera (7-day free trial) and other platforms. Feel free to use any other similar resource that suits your preference.

## CLASS FORMAT

This course is divided into three modules, each ending with a project. After a series of lesson days in each module, you'll have dedicated in-class time to work on your project. In the final week, you’ll present your favorite project in a poster session with your peers and the teaching team.

### Lesson days

Lessons build the skills needed for each project. Each class period begins with a short interactive lecture—reviewing common challenges from the pre-class preparation assignment with interactive polling questions—followed by small-group worksheet activities. A short homework assignment will be due before the next class, and you'll often have time at the end of class to get started on it.

### Project days

You’ll apply your skills in small projects, submitting multiple drafts and improving your work based on feedback from peers and instructors.

### Poster preparation and presentation days

The final three class meetings are for preparing and presenting your final poster. More details will be shared mid-term.

## COURSE GRADES

Your grade is based primarily on three projects. For each, you’ll receive an “editorial decision” such as *Publish*, *Minor Revisions*, or *Major Revisions* (see Project Assessment for details). Your final grade depends on the overall pattern of these decisions, with adjustments based on your Poster Presentation and Engagement Task completion. See Appendix 1 for more detailed grade breakdowns.

### Grade Overview

| Final Grade | Minimum Requirement                                      |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A (85%)** | 3× *Publish* (higher grades possible with *Distinction*) |
| **B (72%)** | 3× *Minor Revisions*                                     |
| **D (50%)** | 3× *Major Revisions*                                     |
| **F**       | Incomplete or missing project(s)                         |

### Grade Modifiers

| Modifier                               | Poster Presentation            | Engagement Tasks           |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| No change                              | *Publish* or *Minor Revisions* | 70–100% of possible points |
| Drop one partial grade (e.g., A → A–)  | *Major Revisions*              | 50–69% of points           |
| Drop two partial grades (e.g., A → B+) | Incomplete or none             | 0–49% of points            |


### Project assessment

Projects in this course involve using computational physics investigations to explore a question and clearly communicate your findings. Assessment is modeled after the academic publishing process. While we don’t use formal peer review, you’ll work through a series of steps to earn an “Accepted for Publication” editorial decision for each project.

**Project Timeline (Recommended Workflow):**

* **Next class after project is assigned:** Complete a short homework to get familiar with the project.
* **One week in:** Share a project draft in class feedback from peers and the teaching team—this mirrors how authors often share drafts with mentors or colleagues before submitting to a journal.
* **Before submitting:** Seek informal feedback from the teaching team during class or office hours. This helps ensure your formal feedback is as useful as possible.
* **Two weeks in:** Submit your project for formal feedback and an editorial decision. Most first submissions will receive *Minor Revisions* at best, just like in real academic publishing where even strong papers are rarely accepted without changes.
* **After feedback:** Ask follow-up questions if needed, revise based on the feedback, and resubmit. Be sure to include a summary of how you addressed the comments.
* **Further revisions:** You can revise and resubmit again if needed—our goal is to help your work improve through the process.

**Editorial Decision Glossary:**

| Decision            | Meaning                                          |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| ***Publish***         | Fully meets criteria, no outstanding issues.           |
| ***Minor Revisions*** | Mostly complete; small issues remain.            |
| ***Major Revisions*** | Key issues need significant work.                |
| ***Incomplete***      | Off-track; meet with instructor before revising. |
| ***No Submission***   | Nothing submitted yet.                           |


**Distinction Points:** 

In academic publishing, outstanding manuscripts are sometimes highlighted by editors for their originality, potential impact, or outstanding communication. Similarly, in this course, projects that go significantly beyond expectations can receive special recognition:

* **Notable (1 distinction point):** Awarded when *an aspect* of your project—such as the analysis, creativity, or clarity—stands out as particularly strong.
* **Exemplary (2 distinction points):** Reserved for projects where *the entire submission* is exceptional across the board in terms of insight, execution, and communication.

Distinction points are only considered for projects that have already earned a *Publish* decision. Each distinction point increases your course grade by 2.5%. More details on how distinction points will be awarded will be provided with the Project 1 guidelines.


### Poster Presentation Assessment

Your poster presentation will receive an editorial decision based on three elements:

* The quality and clarity of your **poster**,
* The effectiveness of your **oral presentation** of the poster, and
* Your ability to **answer follow-up questions** about your work.

Further details will be provided when the Poster Presentation details are released.


### Engagement Tasks

The **Engagement Tasks** category includes activities we consider essential for your learning. Earn **Engagement Task Points** through on-time submissions.

* **Preclass preparation** and **homework** assignments are graded for completion automatically in Canvas. These may be spot-checked by the teaching team, and you could be asked to resubmit work that isn’t complete or thorough enough. Late submissions receive half credit and must be submitted by the **last day of class**.
* **Feedback drafts** of your projects may have minimum completion criteria that require grader review in order to earn engagement task points.
* **Group worksheets** are assessed via **in-class checkpoint questions**. Each student in your group will be asked a different question and can retry as needed until a correct or complete answer is given. If you miss class, you're encouraged to complete the worksheet independently and debrief it in **office hours** to earn credit.
* **iClicker polling questions** do **not** count toward engagement points.

You earn **full credit** in this category by earning **70% or more** of the total possible engagement task points. This threshold allows flexibility—missing or submitting a few tasks late won’t prevent you from receiving the **maximum credit**. For grade penalties associated with earning less than 70%, see the **Course Grades** section.

An estimated breakdown of how engagement points are allocated is provided in **Appendix 2**.


### If you miss a class

Missing a class doesn’t mean falling behind. Here’s how to stay on track:

* **Check Canvas and Jupyter** for lecture slides, notes, and other course materials.
* **Attend office hours**, either in person or via Zoom, to review content or ask questions.
* **Engage on Piazza** with the teaching team and your classmates.
* If you miss a day with a **group worksheet** engagement task, you can complete the worksheet on your own and bring it to **office hours** for a short debrief to earn engagement task points.


### Project Submission Deadlines

Rather than offering extensions, this course uses **weekly project submission deadlines**. At each deadline, you may submit **one project** (either a first submission or a revision). You’re free to choose which project to submit when, though we’ve included recommended deadlines below to help keep you on track.

If you miss a deadline, no problem—the next one will already be open, and you can submit there instead.

|                            | Oct 02    | Oct 09 | Oct 16             | Oct 23    | Oct 30 | Nov 06             | Nov 20    | Nov 27 | Dec 04             | Dec 10                        | Dec 16                   |
| :------------------------- | :-------- | :----- | :----------------- | :-------- | :----- | :----------------- | :-------- | :----- | :----------------- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Submission Deadline**    | #1        | #2     | #3                 | #4        | #5     | #6                 | #7        | #8     | #9                 | #10                           | #11                      |
| **Recommended Submission** | Project 1 |        | Project 1 revision | Project 2 |        | Project 2 revision | Project 3 |        | Project 3 revision | Project 1 or 2 final revision | Project 3 final revision |

#### Important Notes:

* **Grading turnaround:** Graders are given **one week** after each deadline to return feedback. Plan accordingly—leave **at least two weeks** between your initial submission and your planned revision deadline.

* **Submission frequency:** Most projects require **2–3 rounds** to reach “Publish.” Expect to submit **something at nearly every deadline** to stay on pace.

> **HELPING YOU STAY ON TRACK** - If you miss **two consecutive submission deadlines**, I’ll reach out to schedule a meeting. This is to help keep you on track. Last year, several students failed the course because they didn’t complete one or more projects to at least a *Major Revisions* level. I want to help you avoid that situation.


### Academic Concessions

If require need academic concessions beyond the flexible course policies outlined above, please reach out to **Joss** directly. Concessions may be granted for situations involving:

* **Conflicting responsibilities**
* **Medical circumstances**
* **Compassionate grounds**

Refer to the [UBC Science Academic Concession page](https://science.ubc.ca/students/concession) for full details. In some cases, **documentation or advisor correspondence** may be required for a concession to be approved.


## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND COLLABORATION

The academic community is built on honesty, civility, and integrity. As a member of this community, you are expected to understand and follow UBC’s codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.

At its core, academic integrity means:

* Submitting only **original work** done by you
* Acknowledging all **sources of information and ideas**
* Not **copying**, or **misrepresenting** someone else’s work as your own

Violations—such as plagiarism or cheating—may result in serious consequences, including your work being permanently considered *Not Submitted*, or referral to the **Dean’s office**, where formal records are kept.

You can find full university policies on academic integrity in the [UBC Academic Calendar](http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).


### Your Intellectual Contribution

All submitted or presented work should reflect **your own understanding** and demonstrate your **significant intellectual contributions**. This applies to code and written content, whether or not it was supported by **Generative AI (GenAI)** tools.

Using GenAI is acceptable **when your engagement with it involves meaningful use of your skills and course knowledge**. For example:

* Iteratively refining prompts to produce working code
* Carefully testing, debugging, and improving AI-generated code based on your understanding

However, tasks in this course are **not intended** to be completed simply by searching for solutions or using one-line GenAI prompts. If you're unsure whether your use of a tool meets expectations, ask the teaching team—it's always better to check than risk an academic misconduct case.


### Policies regarding Generative AI

This course encourages the **responsible use of GenAI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, CoPilot, Gemini) as part of your computational toolkit.

We’ll practice prompt design, code evaluation, and debugging together. Unless otherwise stated, you must:

* **Attribute** any code or ideas generated with help from GenAI
* **Describe how GenAI supported your work**, especially when used for troubleshooting or structuring code

You don’t need to share exact prompts, but your attribution should reflect your process. For example:

> “After modifying the Project 1 starter code to incorporate friction, I noticed objects were traveling backward after stopping. I asked CoPilot about this behavior, and it helped me revise the code.”


### Additional Academic Integrity Policies in PHYS 210

* **Attribution:**
  It’s fine to use small snippets of code from peers or online sources if you **credit them properly**. For GenAI, larger sections of code are acceptable **only if** you’ve made significant intellectual contributions (as described above) and clearly explain how the tool supported your work.

* **Formal group work:**
  Collaboration is encouraged! You should engage actively in group activities and ensure you understand all group-generated work. Ask questions, contribute, and learn together.

* **Individual work:**
  Submitting a shared or copied version of a project, whether directly or slightly modified, is **not acceptable**. Individual submissions must represent your own work and understanding.
  

## UNIVERSITY SUPPORT AND RESOURCES

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available: https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success


## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

* The 2022 version of this syllabus was a revision and update of Prof Carl Michal's 2021 Physics 210 syllabus, and has subsequently been revised multiple times.
* GenAI was used to recommend revisions to this document to make it more concise and welcoming to students.


## APPENDIX 1: COMPLETE GRADE DECISION TABLE
