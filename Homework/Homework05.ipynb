We want to see a \"new-style\" caption (see https://www.internationalscienceediting.com/how-to-write-a-figure-caption/) that provides both the context and an interpretation of what is shown in the graph. It should not be just a passive description of the variables shown. Communicate a take-away message to the reader!\n",

These types of plots can also be extremely valuable in troubleshooting your code, or otherwise validating that your simulation is behaving as intended."

Many questions have purposeful errors in the distributed version so make sure you have fixed them all such that \"Restart & Run All\" will run through the whole book and successfully print \"The notebook ran without errors\" at the end. If you have any trouble resolving the errors, please ask one of your classmates or ask us in class or on Piazza.\n",
