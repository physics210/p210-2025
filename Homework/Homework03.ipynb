This means that you'll be able to set points within your code where the execution will pause and you will be able to observe what the current values are that are stored in all of your variables.

    "\n",
    "![](img/homework04-newtwon-method.png)\n",

You then evaluate the function, $f(x_0)$, and its derivative, $f'(x_0)$, at that point. Then using the derivative, slide down the tangent line (in blue) until you get back to the x axis. Call that point $x_1$. Then you can repeat the procedure, getting closer and closer to the root, which is where the equation passes through 0.\n",

    "$$ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$\n",

    "Subject to certain conditions on the function $f(x)$ and its first derivative (that we will not worry about), if $x_0$ is close enough to one of the roots, the sequence will converge to that nearest root.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `n`: This is the number of iterations of Newton's method that was required for convergence. Here we define convergence as when the distance between $x_n$ and one of the roots (`-1` or `1`) is less than 0.02. If the starting value, `x0`, is already within 0.02 of a root, the number of iterations required is 0. If it takes two iterations ($x_1$ and $x_2$), then this should be `n = 2`.\n",

If it gets to a 100th iteration and then does not converge during that iteration, the values above should be `n = 100`, `root = -99`. Otherwise, if it does converge during the 100th iteration, the values should be `n = 100` and then `root = -1` or `root = 1`, as appropriate.\n",
